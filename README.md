# FilebeatToCloud

An easy way to add a Filebeat configuration to your system


## Used Filebeat version

This app currently runs with the 8.3.1 version of Filebeat --> https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/filebeat-8-3-1


## Menu preview :

:warning: For now, you can only use the 1st Menu option, as the other ones are not ready for deployment yet (soon TM)


## New Filebeat configuration :

### General display

:information_source: This page makes you prepare the filebeat.yml file. There are some base field values that you can modify at your ease.

(more info here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-reference-yml.html)

### General usage

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183076414-90952e42-69e7-406a-aa17-2648c9be9705.png)

:information_source: You can add multiple logs input folders paths.

:information_source: If the index doesn't exist in you Cloud instance, it will be automatically created.

:information_source: You can edit the file extension and the attribute separator accrding tou your logs format.

:information_source: Copy/Paste a sample of your logs to identify it's headers and/or how many attributes you need to distinguish in your logs.

:information_source: There is a local '.env' file in the 'FilebeatToCloud\py-scripts\' folder in which you can adress your personal informations.

  For now, you need to create it youself and write the following properties :
  
  ````
  HOSTS=<kibana url>
  USRNAME=<username(usually 'elastic')>
  PASSWORD=<password>
  ````
  
  With it, you won't have to rewrite the same infos everytime.

Then, press the validation button.

Now you can see and modify the attribute names that have been generated by your sample (will be empty if no sample provided)

#### Let's set test our Filebeat instance with the following log column format
```
header1;header2;header3
value1.1;value2.1;value3.1
```

Now let's that our logs doesn't respect that exact format and that some columns content could be missing, like the following :

```
header1;header2;header3
value1.1;value2.1;value3.1
value3.2
value1.3;value2.3;value3.3
value1.4;value3.4
value3.5
value3.6
value3.7
value1.8;value3.8
value1.9;value3.9
value1.10;value2.10;value3.10

```

We can see 3 different logs formats here : not every field is filled.

That would be a problem with a simple Filebeat mapping configuration : the lines wihout the exact number of fields mapped would be ignored.


```value1.3;value2.3;value3.3``` --> OK

```value1.4;value3.4``` --> 1 field missing (2nd column)

```value3.5``` --> 2 fields missing (2nd and 3rd columns)


So let's set up 3 logs fields configuration :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183070162-6c6d685f-2ced-4f8b-8a43-c05fc5db1020.png)

- Set up the first configuration :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183070446-53f4c547-fbca-4266-9c70-d0c5f64a8dba.png)

- Set up the second configuration :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183070612-d9c592ca-4b93-4abd-8cd2-3a07772ac55c.png)

- Set up the third configuration :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183076651-4aa6db5d-066c-4ad0-a305-550146d5a221.png)

And then, set up is done !

Go into the 'FilebeatToCloud\filebeat-8.3.1-windows-x86_64\' folder and start your Filebeat instance in a powershell terminal with the ```.\filebeat.exe -e``` command :

          ```...\FilebeatToCloud\filebeat-8.3.1-windows-x86_64> .\filebeat.exe -e```
 
Before sending any log, let's check our Elastic Cloud indexes (```host:port/app/management/data/index_management/indices```) :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183071659-59de8a6c-65b7-4c86-852a-1c90307aa960.png)

We can see that our index hasn't been created yet.

Now let's send the logs we used as a sample in our 2 input folders :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183072213-2393e79f-ba24-4c20-a890-983b5d8da46d.png)

In folder 1 (as a '.txt' file) :

```
value1.1;value2.1;value3.1
value3.2
value1.3;value2.3;value3.3
value1.4;value3.4
value3.5

```

In folder 2 (as a '.txt' file) :
```
value3.6
value3.7
value1.8;value3.8
value1.9;value3.9
value1.10;value2.10;value3.10

```

Now check if our index has been created :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183072849-f0ef727c-8a6d-4e87-9c9e-f47889ee1a5e.png)

Yes !

Let's now create a Data View to explore our log's data (```host:port/app/management/kibana/dataViews```) :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183073258-b3027fac-907f-4fc8-9da3-c898be7ae735.png)

Now, we can visualize our data in the Kibana Discover section :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183074649-992fe4bb-ae07-485c-80bf-9ec6b24f90a7.png)

We received our 10 rows splitted in the 2 '.txt' files in the 2 precedently set up folders !

Let's now observe our data fields to check if our formats were properly set up :

(We can now select our headers in the field search input)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183074731-016f56ce-6c6f-45e4-be0e-b8c7bde5a6db.png)

:information_source: All the received data are prefixed by 'parsed.'

Now let's properly display our data :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74706889/183075372-e485c1a7-4fc7-4d60-8d7d-457862fff5f1.png)

Wonderful ! Our data fields are perfectly classified !

You can now use the FilebeatToCloud application to send your logs with your very own formats on your cloud !


## Ideas

Make a upper level menu to choose to add a new Filebeat configuration or to use an existing/ancient one

Being able to export / import a gonfiguration --> generated/parserscript.js + generated/headersConfigs/config_..js + filebeat.yml

Being able to have multiple Filebeat instances/services + create a management panel


### Disclaimer

I don't to modify any file / folder content or name or the app could stop working
